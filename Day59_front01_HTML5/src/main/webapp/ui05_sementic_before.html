<h2>Sementic Layout</h2>
<p>With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!</p>
<p>Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!</p>

	<h1>London</h1>
	<p>London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom.[8][9] The city stands on the River Thames in southeast England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea. London has been a major settlement for two millennia.[10] The City of London, London's ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans and originally called Londinium; with an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile, it retains boundaries that closely follow its medieval limits.[note 1][11][12][13][14][15] The adjacent City of Westminster has for centuries been the location of much of the national government. Thirty-one additional boroughs north and south of the river also comprise modern London. The London region is governed by the mayor of London and the London Assembly.[note 2][16][17]s</p>
	<p>London is one of the world's most important global cities.[18] It exerts considerable influence on the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism, and transportation.[19] It is one of the largest financial centres in the world and in 2019, London had the second highest number of ultra high-net-worth individuals in Europe, after Paris.[20] And in 2020, London had the second-highest number of billionaires of any city in Europe, after Moscow.[21] London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe,[22] and London is home to highly ranked institutions such as Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, as well as the comprehensive University College London.[23] In 2012, London became the first city to have hosted three modern Summer Olympic Games.[24][7]</p>
